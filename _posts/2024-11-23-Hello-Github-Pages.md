### Hello Everyone,
---

I am Aravindh pursuing Computer Science Engineering from Sathyabama University. I am writing this to focus on my studies and tasks that I do to improve my skills. Most of the time, people around me try to bring me down by disturbing me in various ways. I am resilient and have learned new ways to cope with reality, adapt myself, and grow even in such an environment. I am the elder son in my family, and I have the topmost responsibility of carrying my family. As it may sound very obvious, though, it is not easy for me because my life is different from any of yours. Of course, I cannot explain everything here with a clear explanation, but one day I feel like I can be more relaxed about my life and things be happier with what I have and enjoy and give to people around me and not bother them. I hope you got some kind of realization or feeling from this small verse, which I will elaborate on in the future. Now, I am signing off!.
